		<div class="headline">The ways in which illegal poachers use endangered animals parts.</div>
		<div class="subhead">By Taylor Horn</div>
		<br>
		<div class="text">Whether it be for personal or economic gain, endangered species are continuing to be poached for mass profit across the globe. According to the World Animal Foundation, around 20 billion dollars is made off the illegal trade of endangered species, with tens of millions of species being captured each year. Data gathered from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), in 2016 shows that only 1755 endangered species were seized from other countries that were trying to import an endangered species into the US. This small percentage of recovered imports from the millions of endangered species traded gives us an insight into what species are most traded, what the most common use for them would be, and which countries are importing the most into the United States. <br><br> Below is a look at some of the most imported endangered species into the U.S. and what they are commonly used for.</div>
		<div class="animal-chart">
			<div class="animal-pic">
				<img src="img/clam.svg">
				<span class="name">Clams and corals</span>
				<p class="factoid">Sea creatures such as clams and corals dominate the endangered species trade market. There were 192 instances of corals being imported into the United States illegally and 42 instances of clams. This accounts for 13% of all of the seized species that were illegally imported in 2016.</p>

			<div class="chart-description">
				<p> The United States Fish and Wildlife Service provides an in depth look at the general purpose of every imported endangered species. These are classified as the following: breeding in captivity or artificial propagation, law enforcement/judicial/forensic use only, scientific, educational, biomedical research, commercial, botanic gardens, personal, reintroduction/introduction into the wild, hunting trophies, circuses/traveling exhibitions, and zoos. In 2016, personal and commercial purposes dominated the list from the confiscated endangered species.
